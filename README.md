### My Projects :

**1. RISC-V Based SoC** 

   Understood the basics of Synthesis. Got exposure to Timing dot Libs, Constraints, Optimizations and Quality Checks on RISC-V Design. Implemented the complete       Physical design flow of rvmyth using nangate45nm Technology Node. And, tried to integrate rvmyth - Digital block, PLL and DAC - Analog blocks LEF files to the design. 
Tools used : Design Compiler, IC Compiler II

**2. RISC-V Core**

   Implemented RISC-V, 5-Stage pipelined core using Transaction-level Verilog (TL-Verilog) on Makerchip platform under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh and Steve Hoover.  Implemented a 32-Bit RISC-V Processor in OpenLane Flow from Synthesis to Final GSDII Layout using SkyWater 130nm PDKs and OpenSource Tools like Magic on Ubuntu OS. 
Tools used : Makerchip IDE, RISC-V ISA Simulator, RISC-V GNU Tool-chain, Spike 3-Bit 

**3. CMOS Wallace Tree Multiplier**

   Implemented a 3-bit Multiplier circuit using Wallace Tree reduction technique. Design of the multiplier is done on eSim Workspace, Schematics for AND gate, XOR gate, half adder, full adder and the 3-bit Wallace multiplier circuit is created. These circuits were Designed & Simulated using NGSpice, SkyWater 130nm PDKs and their waveforms were observed using GTKWave. 

**4. 10-Bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**

   The project aims to deal with a 10-Bit Potentiometric DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), Implemented on Synopsys Custom Compiler and PrimeWave using SAED32_28nm with a typical Digital Power Supply (VDD) of 1.05V and a typical Analog Voltage Supply (VDDA) of 1.8V. The basic idea is to divide the voltage into N different voltage values in the range of VREFH and VREFL for a N-Bit DAC. 

**5. 10-Bit Serializer** 

   The purpose of this project is to produce clean GDS Final Layout with all details that is used in the fabrication of a Behavioral RTL of a 10-bit Serializer using SkyWater 130nm PDK. RTL Code, TestBench is written and RTL2GDSII is obtained using the OpenLane Flow. Pre-Layout, Layout and Post-Layout were successfully generated and verified using the OpenSource Tools. 

**6. Traffic Light Controller using Verilog** 

   A methodology is developed to control the Traffic flow with specified time delays for a T-Shaped road. RTL Code and TestBench, written in Verilog HDL were developed for the same and simulated in Xilinx ISE Design Suite.

**7. Automatic Temperature Controlled Fan** 

   Worked with ARDUINO Development board for Automatic Fan controlling system using Thermistor. Developed the Arduino Codes for both Transmitter and Receiver which is tested for temperatures ranging (25-35)Â° C.


### My Work Experience :

**1. Training Intern** [(Apr '22 - Present) at VSD (VLSI System Design) and SFAL (Semiconductor Fabless Accelerator Lab)]

   Designed and Implemented 10-Bit DAC Custom Layout on Synopsys Custom Compiler Tool using SAED32_28nm. The results were simulated and verified using PrimeWave. Extracted the LEF File while challenges included to clear the DRC and LVS Violations. 

   Implemented RISC-V based MYTH on Makerchip and GTKWave written in TL-Verilog. Understood the basic concepts behind Design & SPICE Simulations, Custom Layout, DAC IP design using eSim and Sky130 PDKs, Mixed-signal RISC-V based SoC. Synthesis done using Design Compiler (DC) for RISC-V. Got exposure to Constraints, Optimizations and Quality Checks on RISC-V Design. 

   Implemented the complete Physical design of rvmyth using Nangate45nm Technology Node. Tried to integrate rvmyth - Digital block, PLL and DAC - Analog blocks LEF files to the design, integrating rvmyth, PLL and DAC into a SoC, which is named as VSDBabySoC with some future works. 

   Tools used : Design Compiler, Custom Compiler - PrimeWave, IC Compiler II 

   PDKs worked on : SAED32_28nm, SkyWater 130nm, Nangate45nm 


**2. Malayalam NLU & ASR model for Rasa using Spacy, Fast Text, Jarvis** [(Jul '21 - Feb '22) at SAMSUNG PRISM]

   A conversational framework based on AI, NLP and ASR was build which will be used by Samsung India. Understood the basic concepts of Rasa Framework, NLP, Transfer  Learning and Fasttext Library. Malayalam model on Rasa Framework has been tested and verified with the Samsung Datascripts. 

   Running of validation analysis test on the Bot is performed. 

   Survey is done on an alternative to Jarvis. 


**3. Signal Processing Simulations and Introduction to VHDL Programming** [(Sep '21 - Oct '21) at CASDIC (Formerly DARE) - Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)]

   The Internship training has been undertaken in Electronic Warfare advance technology, Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), DRDO for a duration of 1 month. Understood the RADAR Systems and Real-time complexity behind the Signal Generation & Processing in the presence of noise during Electronic Warfare. 

   Real-time MATLAB codes were developed for the computation of a DFT Matrix generation for a NxN matrix and Signal generation & Computation in the presence of noise. 


**4. IP Research Intern** [(Jun '21 - Aug '21) at VLSI System Design Pvt. Ltd. and FOSSEE, IIT Bombay]

   Compiled Verilog Behavioral model of a 10-Bit Serializer. Synthesized RTL Design with SkyWater 130nm PDKs. 

   Looked into Google SkyWater PDK for Gate Level Simulation. Completed the Synthesis and Physical Design flow (Floorplan, Placement and Routing) of a Serializer and successfully extracted the Final GDSII Layout. 

   Designed and understood the circuit of 2:1 MUX in eSim Workspace and Simulated using NGSpice, GTKWave and Sky130nm Technology node.
