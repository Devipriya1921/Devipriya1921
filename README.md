### My Projects :

**1. RISC-V Based SoC** 

â€¢ Implemented RISC-V, 5-Stage pipelined core using Transaction-level Verilog (TL-Verilog) on Makerchip platform.
â€¢ Implemented a 32-Bit RISC-V Processor in OpenLane Flow from RTL2GDS using SkyWater 130nm PDKs and OpenSource Tools
like Magic.
â€¢ Understood the basics of Synthesis. Got exposure to Constraints on RISC-V Design. Implemented the Physical design flow of
RISC-V using Nangate45nm Technology Node. And, tried to integrate PLL and DAC - Analog blocks LEF files with the rvmyth -
Digital block design.
â€¢ Tools used : Design Compiler, IC Compiler II, Makerchip IDE, RISC-V GCC Compiler and Spike Simulator.


**2. 10-Bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**

   The project aims to deal with designing a 10-Bit Potentiometric DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) using SAED32-28nm PDKs.
Implemented the design on Synopsys Custom Compiler and verified the functionality using PrimeWave consisting of switches
and extracted LEF File of the DAC design. 


**3. CMOS Wallace Tree Multiplier**

   â€¢ Implemented a 3-bit Multiplier circuit using Wallace Tree reduction technique. Design of the multiplier schematic is done on
eSim EDA Tool. This circuit is simulated using NGSpice and the technology node used is SkyWater 130nm.


**4. 10-Bit Serializer** 

   Behavioral RTL of a 10-bit Serializer using SkyWater 130nm PDK is done. RTL code is synthesized using Yosys, performed PnR
Flow using OpenSource Tools and functionality is verified using GTKWave.


**5. Traffic Light Controller using Verilog** 

   A methodology is developed to control the Traffic flow with specified time delays for a T-Shaped road. RTL Code and TestBench, written in Verilog HDL were developed for the same and simulated in Xilinx ISE Design Suite.

**6. Automatic Temperature Controlled Fan** 

   Worked with ARDUINO Development board for Automatic Fan controlling system using Thermistor. Developed the Arduino Codes for both Transmitter and Receiver which is tested for temperatures ranging (25-35)Â° C.


### My Work Experience :

**1. Physical Design Trainee** [(Apr '22 - Present) at VSD (VLSI System Design) and SFAL (Semiconductor Fabless Accelerator Lab)]

â€¢ Designed and Implemented 10-Bit DAC Schematic and Layout on Synopsys Custom Compiler Tool using SAED32-28nm PDK. The results were simulated and verified using PrimeWave. And, Extracted the LEF File.
â€¢ Implemented RISC-V on Makerchip, written in TL-Verilog (Transaction Level) and verfied the functionality using GTKWave..
â€¢ Understood the basic concepts behind DAC IP design, Mixed-signal RISC-V based SoC.
â€¢ Synthesis done using Design Compiler (DC) for RISC-V. Got exposure to Constraints on the RISC-V Design.
â€¢ Implemented the complete Physical design flow of RISC-V using Nangate45nm Technology Node.
â€¢ Tools used : Custom Compiler - PrimeWave, Design Compiler, IC Compiler II
â€¢ PDKs worked on : SAED32-28nm, Nangate45nm


**2. Malayalam NLU & ASR model for Rasa using Spacy, Fast Text, Jarvis** [(Jul '21 - Feb '22) at SAMSUNG PRISM]

â€¢ A conversational framework based on AI, NLP and ASR was build which will be used by Samsung India. Understood the basic concepts of Rasa Framework, NLP, Transfer  Learning and Fasttext Library. Malayalam model on Rasa Framework has been tested and verified with the Samsung Datascripts. 
â€¢ Running of validation analysis test on the Bot is performed. 
â€¢ Survey is done on an alternative to Jarvis. 


**3. Signal Processing Simulations and Introduction to VHDL Programming** [(Sep '21 - Oct '21) at CASDIC (Formerly DARE) - Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)]

â€¢ The Internship training has been undertaken in Electronic Warfare advance technology, Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), DRDO for a duration of 1 month. Understood the RADAR Systems and Real-time complexity behind the Signal Generation & Processing in the presence of noise during Electronic Warfare. 
â€¢ Real-time MATLAB codes were developed for the computation of a DFT Matrix generation for a NxN matrix and Signal generation & Computation in the presence of noise. 


**4. IP Research Intern** [(Jun '21 - Aug '21) at VLSI System Design Pvt. Ltd. and FOSSEE, IIT Bombay]

â€¢ Verilog Behavioral model of a 10-Bit Serializer was written. Synthesized RTL Design using the Yosys tool and verified the
gate-level simulation using GTKWave.
â€¢ Performed the Physical Design flow (Floorplan, Placement and Routing) of a Serializer and successfully generated the Final GDSII
Layout. Designed and understood the circuit of 2:1 MUX in eSim Workspace using Sky130nm Technology node and Simulated
using NGSpice.
